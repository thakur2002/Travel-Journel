        description:"Mount Fuji is the tallest mountain in Japan, standing at 3776 metres (12,380 feet). Mount Fuji is the single most popular tourist site in Japan, for both Japanese and foreign tourists. Climbing Mount Fuji has long been a religious practice. Today huge crowds flock there, mostly during the climbing season from July 1 to August 26. Cities such as Fuji and Gotemba, at the foot of the mountain, serve as a base for climbers. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) designated Mount Fuji a World Heritage site in 2013.",

        description:"A great urban sculpture set in a remarkable waterscape, at the tip of a peninsula projecting into Sydney Harbour, the building has had an enduring influence on architecture. The Sydney Opera House comprises three groups of interlocking vaulted ‘shells’ which roof two main performance halls and a restaurant. These shell-structures are set upon a vast platform and are surrounded by terrace areas that function as pedestrian concourses. In 1957, when the project of the Sydney Opera House was awarded by an international jury to Danish architect Jørn Utzon, it marked a radically new approach to construction.",
